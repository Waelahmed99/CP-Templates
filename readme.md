# Competitive Programming Templates
This template is made for competitive programming using `C++` language. <br>
If you want a good roadmap for practicing problem solving, use Mostafa Saad's [Junior sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iJZWP2nS_OB3kCTjq8L6TrJJ4o-5lhxDOyTaocSYc-k/edit#gid=84654839), and try my [add-on](https://github.com/Waelahmed99/junior-sheet-add-on) to make it easier <br> 

For other useful templates, see [Ahmed Hossam's template](https://github.com/7oSkaaa/CP-Templates)
